## Practical SQL: A Beginner's Guide to Storytelling with Data

[Practical SQL](https://www.nostarch.com/practicalSQL) from No Starch Press is a beginner-friendly guide to the database programming language SQL. Journalist and data analyst  [Anthony DeBarros](https://www.anthonydebarros.com) begins with SQL basics, using the free open-source database PostgreSQL and interface pgAdmin, and walks through intermediate and advanced topics including statistics, aggregation, cleaning data, GIS and automating tasks. Along the way, you'll use real-world data from the U.S. Census and other government agencies and learn the fundamentals of good database design. This book is ideal for beginners as well as those who know some SQL and want to go deeper.

Practical SQL is [available in PDF, .mobi, .epub, and classic print formats](https://www.nostarch.com/practicalSQL).

## Getting the Code and Data on Your Computer

**Non-GitHub Users**

You can obtain all the code and data at once by downloading this repository as a .zip file. To do that:

* Click the **Code** button at top right.
* Click **Download ZIP**
* Unzip the file on your computer. Place it in a directory that's easy to remember so you can reference it during the exercises that include importing data to PostgreSQL.

**Warning about CSV files!**: Opening CSV files with Excel could lead to data loss. Excel will remove leading zeros from numbers that are intended to be stored as text, such as zip codes. If you wish to view the contents of a CSV file, only do so with a plain-text editor and be careful not to save the file in an encoding other than UTF-8 (e.g., `Notepad.exe` on Windows defaults to ANSI).

**GitHub Users**

GitHub users may want to clone the repository locally and occasionally perform a `git pull` to receive any updates.
