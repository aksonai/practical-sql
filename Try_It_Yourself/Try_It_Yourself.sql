-- Practical SQL: A Beginner's Guide to Storytelling with Data
-- by Anthony DeBarros

-- Try It Yourself Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------


--------------------------------------------------------------
-- Chapter 1: Creating Your First Database and Table
--------------------------------------------------------------

-- 1. Imagine you're building a database to catalog all the animals at your
-- local zoo. You want one table for tracking all the kinds of animals and
-- another table to track the specifics on each animal. Write CREATE TABLE
-- statements for each table that include some of the columns you need. Why did
-- you include the columns you chose?

-- Answer (yours will vary):

-- The first table will hold the animal types and their conservation status:

CREATE TABLE animal_types (
   animal_type_id bigserial CONSTRAINT animal_types_key PRIMARY KEY,
   common_name varchar(100) NOT NULL,
   scientific_name varchar(100) NOT NULL,
   conservation_status varchar(50) NOT NULL
);

-- Note that I have added keywords on some columns that define constraints
-- such as a PRIMARY KEY. You will learn about these in Chapters 6 and 7.

-- The second table will hold data on individual animals. Note that the
-- column animal_type_id references the column of the same name in the
-- table animal types. This is a foreign key, which you will learn about in
-- Chapter 7.

CREATE TABLE menagerie (
   menagerie_id bigserial CONSTRAINT menagerie_key PRIMARY KEY,
   animal_type_id bigint REFERENCES animal_types (animal_type_id),
   date_acquired date NOT NULL,
   gender varchar(1),
   acquired_from varchar(100),
   name varchar(100),
   notes text
);

-- 2. Now create INSERT statements to load sample data into the tables.
-- How can you view the data via the pgAdmin tool?

-- Answer (again, yours will vary):

INSERT INTO animal_types (common_name, scientific_name, conservation_status)
VALUES ('Bengal Tiger', 'Panthera tigris tigris', 'Endangered'),
       ('Arctic Wolf', 'Canis lupus arctos', 'Least Concern');
-- data source: https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/directory?direction=desc&sort=extinction_status

INSERT INTO menagerie (animal_type_id, date_acquired, gender, acquired_from, name, notes)
VALUES
(1, '3/12/1996', 'F', 'Dhaka Zoo', 'Ariel', 'Healthy coat at last exam.'),
(2, '9/30/2000', 'F', 'National Zoo', 'Freddy', 'Strong appetite.');

-- To view data via pgAdmin, in the object browser, right-click Tables and
-- select Refresh. Then right-click the table name and select
-- View/Edit Data > All Rows

-- 2b. Create an additional INSERT statement for one of your tables. On purpose,
-- leave out one of the required commas separating the entries in the VALUES
-- clause of the query. What is the error message? Does it help you find the
-- error in the code?

-- Answer: In this case, the error message points to the missing comma.

INSERT INTO animal_types (common_name, scientific_name, conservation_status)
VALUES ('Javan Rhino', 'Rhinoceros sondaicus' 'Critically Endangered');

--------------------------------------------------------------
-- Chapter 2: Beginning Data Exploration with SELECT
--------------------------------------------------------------

-- 1. The school district superintendent asks for a list of teachers in each
-- school. Write a query that lists the schools in alphabetical order along
-- with teachers ordered by last name A-Z.

-- Answer:

SELECT school, first_name, last_name
FROM teachers
ORDER BY school, last_name;

-- 2. Write a query that finds the one teacher whose first name starts
-- with the letter 'S' and who earns more than $40,000.

-- Answer:

SELECT first_name, last_name, school, salary
FROM teachers
WHERE first_name LIKE 'S%' -- remember that LIKE is case-sensitive!
      AND salary > 40000;

-- 3. Rank teachers hired since Jan. 1, 2010, ordered by highest paid to lowest.

-- Answer:

SELECT last_name, first_name, school, hire_date, salary
FROM teachers
WHERE hire_date >= '2010-01-01'
ORDER BY salary DESC;


--------------------------------------------------------------
-- Chapter 3: Understanding Data Types
--------------------------------------------------------------

-- 1. Your company delivers fruit and vegetables to local grocery stores, and
-- you need to track the mileage driven by each driver each day to a tenth
-- of a mile. Assuming no driver would ever travel more than 999 miles in
-- a day, what would be an appropriate data type for the mileage column in your
-- table. Why?

-- Answer:

numeric(4,1)

-- numeric(4,1) provides four digits total (the precision) and one digit after
-- the decimal (the scale). That would allow you to store a value as large
-- as 999.9.

-- In practice, you may want to consider that the assumption on maximum miles
-- in a day could conceivably exceed 999.9 and go with the larger numeric(5,1).

-- 2. In the table listing each driver in your company, what are appropriate
-- data types for the driversâ€™ first and last names? Why is it a good idea to
-- separate first and last names into two columns rather than having one
-- larger name column?

-- Answer:

varchar(50)

-- 50 characters is a reasonable length for names, and varchar() ensures you
-- will not waste space when names are shorter. Separating first and last names
-- into their own columns will let you later sort on each independently.

-- 3. Assume you have a text column that includes strings formatted as dates.
-- One of the strings is written as '4//2017'. What will happen when you try
-- to convert that string to the timestamp data type?

-- Answer: Attempting to convert a string of text that does not conform to
-- accepted date/time formats will result in an error. You can see this with
-- the below example, which tries to cast the string as a timestamp.

SELECT CAST('4//2017' AS timestamp with time zone);


--------------------------------------------------------------
-- Chapter 4: Importing and Exporting Data
--------------------------------------------------------------

-- 1. Write a WITH statement to include with COPY to handle the import of an
-- imaginary text file that has a first couple of rows that look like this:

-- id:movie:actor
-- 50:#Mission: Impossible#:Tom Cruise

-- Answer: The WITH statement will need the options seen here:

COPY actors
FROM 'C:\YourDirectory\movies.txt'
WITH (FORMAT CSV, HEADER, DELIMITER ':', QUOTE '#');

-- If you'd like to try actually importing this data, save the data in a file
-- called movies.txt and create the actors table below. You can then run the COPY
-- statement.

CREATE TABLE actors (
    id integer,
    movie text,
    actor text
);

-- Note: You may never encounter a file that uses a colon as a delimiter and
-- pound sign for quoting, but anything is possible.

-- 2. Using the table us_counties_2010 you created and filled in this chapter,
-- export to a CSV file the 20 counties in the United States that have the most
-- housing units. Make sure you export only each county's name, state, and
-- number of housing units. (Hint: Housing units are totaled for each county in
-- the column housing_unit_count_100_percent.

-- Answer:

COPY (
    SELECT geo_name, state_us_abbreviation, housing_unit_count_100_percent
    FROM us_counties_2010 ORDER BY housing_unit_count_100_percent DESC LIMIT 20
     )
TO 'C:\YourDirectory\us_counties_housing_export.txt'
WITH (FORMAT CSV, HEADER);

-- Note: This COPY statement uses a SELECT statement to limit the output to
-- only the desired columns and rows.

-- 3. Imagine you're importing a file that contains a column with these values:
      -- 17519.668
      -- 20084.461
      -- 18976.335
-- Will a column in your target table with data type numeric(3,8) work for these
-- values? Why or why not?

-- Answer:
-- No, it won't. In fact, you won't even be able to create a column with that
-- data type because the precision must be larger than the scale. The correct
-- type for the example data is numeric(8,3).


--------------------------------------------------------------
-- Chapter 5: Basic Math and Stats with SQL
--------------------------------------------------------------

-- 1. Write a SQL statement for calculating the area of a circle whose radius is
-- 5 inches. Do you need parentheses in your calculation? Why or why not?

-- Answer:
-- (The formula for the area of a circle is: pi * radius squared.)

SELECT 3.14 * 5 ^ 2;

-- The result is an area of 78.5 square inches.
-- Note: You do not need parentheses because exponents and roots take precedence
-- over multiplication. However, you could include parentheses for clarity. This
-- statement produces the same result:

SELECT 3.14 * (5 ^ 2);

-- 2. Using the 2010 Census county data, find out which New York state county
-- has the highest percentage of the population that identified as "American
-- Indian/Alaska Native Alone." What can you learn about that county from online
-- research that explains the relatively large proportion of American Indian
-- population compared with other New York counties?

-- Answer:
-- Franklin County, N.Y., with 7.4%. The county contains the St. Regis Mohawk
-- Reservation. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Regis_Mohawk_Reservation

SELECT geo_name,
       state_us_abbreviation,
       p0010001 AS total_population,
       p0010005 AS american_indian_alaska_native_alone,
       (CAST (p0010005 AS numeric(8,1)) / p0010001) * 100
           AS percent_american_indian_alaska_native_alone
FROM us_counties_2010
WHERE state_us_abbreviation = 'NY'
ORDER BY percent_american_indian_alaska_native_alone DESC;

-- 3. Was the 2010 median county population higher in California or New York?

-- Answer:
-- California had a median county population of 179,140.5 in 2010, almost double
-- that of New York, at 91,301. Here are two solutions:

-- First, you can find the median for each state one at a time:

SELECT percentile_cont(.5)
        WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY p0010001)
FROM us_counties_2010
WHERE state_us_abbreviation = 'NY';

SELECT percentile_cont(.5)
        WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY p0010001)
FROM us_counties_2010
WHERE state_us_abbreviation = 'CA';

-- Or both in one query (credit: https://github.com/Kennith-eng)

SELECT state_us_abbreviation,
       percentile_cont(0.5)
          WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY p0010001) AS median
FROM us_counties_2010
WHERE state_us_abbreviation IN ('NY', 'CA')
GROUP BY state_us_abbreviation;

-- Finally, this query shows the median for each state:

SELECT state_us_abbreviation,
       percentile_cont(0.5)
          WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY p0010001) AS median
FROM us_counties_2010
GROUP BY state_us_abbreviation;


--------------------------------------------------------------
-- Chapter 6: Joining Tables in a Relational Database
--------------------------------------------------------------

-- 1. The table us_counties_2010 contains 3,143 rows, and us_counties_2000 has
-- 3,141. That reflects the ongoing adjustments to county-level geographies that
-- typically result from government decision making. Using appropriate joins and
-- the NULL value, identify which counties don't exist in both tables. For fun,
-- search online to  nd out why theyâ€™re missing

-- Answers:

-- Counties that exist in 2010 data but not 2000 include five county equivalents
-- in Alaska (called boroughs) plus Broomfield County, Colorado.

SELECT c2010.geo_name,
       c2010.state_us_abbreviation,
       c2000.geo_name
FROM us_counties_2010 c2010 LEFT JOIN us_counties_2000 c2000
ON c2010.state_fips = c2000.state_fips
   AND c2010.county_fips = c2000.county_fips
WHERE c2000.geo_name IS NULL;

-- Counties that exist in 2000 data but not 2010 include three county
-- equivalents in Alaska (called boroughs) plus Clifton Forge city, Virginia,
-- which gave up its independent city status in 2001:

SELECT c2010.geo_name,
       c2000.geo_name,
       c2000.state_us_abbreviation
FROM us_counties_2010 c2010 RIGHT JOIN us_counties_2000 c2000
ON c2010.state_fips = c2000.state_fips
   AND c2010.county_fips = c2000.county_fips
WHERE c2010.geo_name IS NULL;

-- 2. Using either the median() or percentile_cont() functions in Chapter 5,
-- determine the median of the percent change in county population.

-- Answer: 3.2%

-- Using median():

SELECT median(round( (CAST(c2010.p0010001 AS numeric(8,1)) - c2000.p0010001)
           / c2000.p0010001 * 100, 1 )) AS median_pct_change
FROM us_counties_2010 c2010 INNER JOIN us_counties_2000 c2000
ON c2010.state_fips = c2000.state_fips
   AND c2010.county_fips = c2000.county_fips;

-- Using percentile_cont():

SELECT percentile_cont(.5)
       WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY round( (CAST(c2010.p0010001 AS numeric(8,1)) - c2000.p0010001)
           / c2000.p0010001 * 100, 1 )) AS percentile_50th
FROM us_counties_2010 c2010 INNER JOIN us_counties_2000 c2000
ON c2010.state_fips = c2000.state_fips
   AND c2010.county_fips = c2000.county_fips;

-- Note: In both examples, you're finding the median of all the
-- county population percent change values.


-- 3. Which county had the greatest percentage loss of population between 2000
-- and 2010? Do you have any idea why? Hint: a weather event happened in 2005.

-- Answer: St. Bernard Parish, La. It and other Louisiana parishes (the county
-- equivalent name in Louisiana) experienced substantial population loss
-- following Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

SELECT c2010.geo_name,
       c2010.state_us_abbreviation,
       c2010.p0010001 AS pop_2010,
       c2000.p0010001 AS pop_2000,
       c2010.p0010001 - c2000.p0010001 AS raw_change,
       round( (CAST(c2010.p0010001 AS DECIMAL(8,1)) - c2000.p0010001)
           / c2000.p0010001 * 100, 1 ) AS pct_change
FROM us_counties_2010 c2010 INNER JOIN us_counties_2000 c2000
ON c2010.state_fips = c2000.state_fips
   AND c2010.county_fips = c2000.county_fips
ORDER BY pct_change ASC;

--------------------------------------------------------------
-- Chapter 7: Table Design that Works for You
--------------------------------------------------------------

-- Consider the following two tables from a database youâ€™re making to keep
-- track of your vinyl LP collection. Start by reviewing these CREATE TABLE
-- statements.

-- The albums table includes information specific to the overall collection
-- of songs on the disc. The songs table catalogs each track on the album.
-- Each song has a title and its own artist column, because each song might.
-- feature its own collection of artists.

CREATE TABLE albums (
    album_id bigserial,
    album_catalog_code varchar(100),
    album_title text,
    album_artist text,
    album_time interval,
    album_release_date date,
    album_genre varchar(40),
    album_description text
);

CREATE TABLE songs (
    song_id bigserial,
    song_title text,
    song_artist text,
    album_id bigint
);

-- Use the tables to answer these questions:

-- 1. Modify these CREATE TABLE statements to include primary and foreign keys
-- plus additional constraints on both tables. Explain why you made your
-- choices.

CREATE TABLE albums (
    album_id bigserial,
    album_catalog_code varchar(100) NOT NULL,
    album_title text NOT NULL,
    album_artist text NOT NULL,
    album_release_date date,
    album_genre varchar(40),
    album_description text,
    CONSTRAINT album_id_key PRIMARY KEY (album_id),
    CONSTRAINT release_date_check CHECK (album_release_date > '1/1/1925')
);

CREATE TABLE songs (
    song_id bigserial,
    song_title text NOT NULL,
    song_artist text NOT NULL,
    album_id bigint REFERENCES albums (album_id),
    CONSTRAINT song_id_key PRIMARY KEY (song_id)
);

-- Answers:
-- a) Both tables get a primary key using surrogate key id values that are
-- auto-generated via serial data types.

-- b) The songs table references albums via a foreign key constraint.

-- c) In both tables, the title and artist columns cannot be empty, which
-- is specified via a NOT NULL constraint. We assume that every album and
-- song should at minimum have that information.

-- d) In albums, the album_release_date column has a CHECK constraint
-- because it would be likely impossible for us to own an LP made before 1925.


-- 2. Instead of using album_id as a surrogate key for your primary key, are
-- there any columns in albums that could be useful as a natural key? What would
-- you have to know to decide?

-- Answer:
-- We could consider the album_catalog_code. We would have to answer yes to
-- these questions:
-- - Is it going to be unique across all albums released by all companies?
-- - Will we always have one?


-- 3. To speed up queries, which columns are good candidates for indexes?

-- Answer:
-- Primary key columns get indexes by default, but we should add an index
-- to the album_id foreign key column in the songs table because we'll use
-- it in table joins. It's likely that we'll query these tables to search
-- by titles and artists, so those columns in both tables should get indexes
-- too. The album_release_date in albums also is a candidate if we expect
-- to perform many queries that include date ranges.


----------------------------------------------------------------
-- Chapter 8: Extracting Information by Grouping and Summarizing
----------------------------------------------------------------

-- 1. We saw that library visits have declined in most places. But what is the
-- pattern in the use of technology in libraries? Both the 2014 and 2009 library
-- survey tables contain the columns gpterms (the number of internet-connected
-- computers used by the public) and pitusr (uses of public internet computers
-- per year). Modify the code in Listing 8-13 to calculate the percent change in
-- the sum of each column over time. Watch out for negative values!

-- Answer:
-- Use sum() on gpterms (computer terminals) by state, find percent change, and
-- then sort.

SELECT pls14.stabr,
       sum(pls14.gpterms) AS gpterms_2014,
       sum(pls09.gpterms) AS gpterms_2009,
       round( (CAST(sum(pls14.gpterms) AS decimal(10,1)) - sum(pls09.gpterms)) /
                    sum(pls09.gpterms) * 100, 2 ) AS pct_change
FROM pls_fy2014_pupld14a pls14 JOIN pls_fy2009_pupld09a pls09
ON pls14.fscskey = pls09.fscskey
WHERE pls14.gpterms >= 0 AND pls09.gpterms >= 0
GROUP BY pls14.stabr
ORDER BY pct_change DESC;

-- The query results show a consistent increase in the number of internet
-- computers used by the public in most states.

-- Use sum() on pitusr (uses of public internet computers per year) by state,
-- add percent change, and sort.

SELECT pls14.stabr,
       sum(pls14.pitusr) AS pitusr_2014,
       sum(pls09.pitusr) AS pitusr_2009,
       round( (CAST(sum(pls14.pitusr) AS decimal(10,1)) - sum(pls09.pitusr)) /
                    sum(pls09.pitusr) * 100, 2 ) AS pct_change
FROM pls_fy2014_pupld14a pls14 JOIN pls_fy2009_pupld09a pls09
ON pls14.fscskey = pls09.fscskey
WHERE pls14.pitusr >= 0 AND pls09.pitusr >= 0
GROUP BY pls14.stabr
ORDER BY pct_change DESC;

-- The query results show most states have seen a decrease in the total uses
-- of public internet computers per year.

-- 2. Both library survey tables contain a column called obereg, a two-digit
-- Bureau of Economic Analysis Code that classifies each library agency
-- according to a region of the United States, such as New England, Rocky
-- Mountains, and so on. Just as we calculated the percent change in visits
-- grouped by state, do the same to group percent changes in visits by US
-- regions using obereg. Consult the survey documentation to find the meaning
-- of each region code. For a bonus challenge, create a table with the obereg
-- code as the primary key and the region name as text, and join it to the
-- summary query to group by the region name rather than the code.

-- Answer:

-- a) sum() visits by region.

SELECT pls14.obereg,
       sum(pls14.visits) AS visits_2014,
       sum(pls09.visits) AS visits_2009,
       round( (CAST(sum(pls14.visits) AS decimal(10,1)) - sum(pls09.visits)) /
                    sum(pls09.visits) * 100, 2 ) AS pct_change
FROM pls_fy2014_pupld14a pls14 JOIN pls_fy2009_pupld09a pls09
ON pls14.fscskey = pls09.fscskey
WHERE pls14.visits >= 0 AND pls09.visits >= 0
GROUP BY pls14.obereg
ORDER BY pct_change DESC;

-- b) Bonus: creating the regions lookup table and adding it to the query.

CREATE TABLE obereg_codes (
    obereg varchar(2) CONSTRAINT obereg_key PRIMARY KEY,
    region varchar(50)
);

INSERT INTO obereg_codes

GROUP BY obereg_codes.region
ORDER BY pct_change DESC;


-- 3. Thinking back to the types of joins you learned in Chapter 6, which join
-- type will show you all the rows in both tables, including those without a
-- match? Write such a query and add an IS NULL filter in a WHERE clause to
-- show agencies not included in one or the other table.

-- Answer: a FULL OUTER JOIN will show all rows in both tables.

SELECT pls14.libname, pls14.city, pls14.stabr, pls14.statstru, pls14.c_admin, pls14.branlib,
       pls09.libname, pls09.city, pls09.stabr, pls09.statstru, pls09.c_admin, pls09.branlib
FROM pls_fy2014_pupld14a pls14 FULL OUTER JOIN pls_fy2009_pupld09a pls09
ON pls14.fscskey = pls09.fscskey
WHERE pls14.fscskey IS NULL OR pls09.fscskey IS NULL;

-- Note: The IS NULL statements in the WHERE clause limit results to those
-- that do not appear in both tables.

--------------------------------------------------------------
-- Chapter 9: Inspecting and Modifying Data
--------------------------------------------------------------

-- In this exercise, youâ€™ll turn the meat_poultry_egg_inspect table into useful
-- information. You needed to answer two questions: How many of the companies
-- in the table process meat, and how many process poultry?

-- Create two new columns called meat_processing and poultry_processing. Each
-- can be of the type boolean.

-- Using UPDATE, set meat_processing = TRUE on any row where the activities
-- column contains the text 'Meat Processing'. Do the same update on the
-- poultry_processing column, but this time lookup for the text
-- 'Poultry Processing' in activities.

-- Use the data from the new, updated columns to count how many companies
-- perform each type of activity. For a bonus challenge, count how many
-- companies perform both activities.

-- Answer:
-- a) Add the columns

ALTER TABLE meat_poultry_egg_inspect ADD COLUMN meat_processing boolean;
ALTER TABLE meat_poultry_egg_inspect ADD COLUMN poultry_processing boolean;

SELECT * FROM meat_poultry_egg_inspect; -- view table with new empty columns

-- b) Update the columns

UPDATE meat_poultry_egg_inspect
SET meat_processing = TRUE
WHERE activities ILIKE '%meat processing%'; -- case-insensitive match with wildcards

UPDATE meat_poultry_egg_inspect
SET poultry_processing = TRUE
WHERE activities ILIKE '%poultry processing%'; -- case-insensitive match with wildcards

-- c) view the updated table

SELECT * FROM meat_poultry_egg_inspect;

-- d) Count meat and poultry processors

SELECT count(meat_processing), count(poultry_processing)
FROM meat_poultry_egg_inspect;

-- e) Count those who do both

SELECT count(*)
FROM meat_poultry_egg_inspect
WHERE meat_processing = TRUE AND
      poultry_processing = TRUE;

-- Chapter 10: Statistical Functions in SQL
--------------------------------------------------------------

-- 1. In Listing 10-2, the correlation coefficient, or r value, of the
-- variables pct_bachelors_higher and median_hh_income was about .68.
-- Write a query to show the correlation between pct_masters_higher and
-- median_hh_income. Is the r value higher or lower? What might explain
-- the difference?

-- Answer:
-- The r value of pct_bachelors_higher and median_hh_income is about .57, which
-- shows a lower connection between percent master's degree or higher and

-- 1. Using the New York City taxi data, calculate the length of each ride using
-- the pickup and drop-off timestamps. Sort the query results from the longest
-- ride to the shortest. Do you notice anything about the longest or shortest
-- trips that you might want to ask city officials about?

-- Answer: More than 480 of the trips last more than 10 hours, which seems
-- excessive. Moreover, two records have drop-off times before the pickup time,
-- and several have pickup and drop-off times that are the same. It's worth
-- asking whether these records have timestamp errors.

SELECT
    trip_id,
    tpep_pickup_datetime,

-- 2. Using the AT TIME ZONE keywords, write a query that displays the date and
-- time for London, Johannesburg, Moscow, and Melbourne the moment January 1,
-- 2100, arrives in New York City.

-- Answer:

       '2100-01-01 00:00:00-05' AT TIME ZONE 'Australia/Melbourne' AS melbourne;

-- 3. As a bonus challenge, use the statistics functions in Chapter 10 to
-- calculate the correlation coefficient and r-squared values using trip time
-- and the total_amount column in the New York City taxi data, which represents
-- total amount charged to passengers. Do the same with trip_distance and
-- total_amount. Limit the query to rides that last three hours or less.

-- Answer:

SELECT

          corr(total_amount, (
              date_part('epoch', tpep_dropoff_datetime) -
              date_part('epoch', tpep_pickup_datetime)

WHERE tpep_dropoff_datetime - tpep_pickup_datetime <= '3 hours'::interval;

-- Note: Both correlations are strong, with r values of 0.80 or higher. We'd
-- expect this given that cost of a taxi ride is based on both time and distance.

-- Chapter 12: Advanced Query Techniques
--------------------------------------------------------------

-- 1. Revise the code in Listing 12-15 to dig deeper into the nuances of
-- Waikikiâ€™s high temperatures. Limit the temps_collapsed table to the Waikiki
-- maximum daily temperature observations. Then use the WHEN clauses in the
-- CASE statement to reclassify the temperatures into seven groups that would
-- result in the following text output:

-- '90 or more'
-- '88-89'
-- '86-87'
-- '84-85'
-- '82-83'
-- '80-81'
-- '79 or less'

-- In which of those groups does Waikikiâ€™s daily maximum temperature fall most
-- often?

-- Answer: Between 86 and 87 degrees. Nice.

WITH temps_collapsed (station_name, max_temperature_group) AS
    (SELECT station_name,
           CASE WHEN max_temp >= 90 THEN '90 or more'
                WHEN max_temp BETWEEN 88 AND 89 THEN '88-89'

                WHEN max_temp BETWEEN 80 AND 81 THEN '80-81'
                WHEN max_temp <= 79 THEN '79 or less'
            END
    FROM temperature_readings
    WHERE station_name = 'WAIKIKI 717.2 HI US')

SELECT station_name, max_temperature_group, count(*)
FROM temps_collapsed
GROUP BY station_name, max_temperature_group
ORDER BY max_temperature_group;

-- 2. Revise the ice cream survey crosstab in Listing 12-11 to flip the table.
-- In other words, make flavor the rows and office the columns. Which elements
-- of the query do you need to change? Are the counts different?

-- Answer: You need to re-order the columns in the first subquery so flavor is
-- first and office is second. count(*) stays third. Then, you must change
-- the second subquery to produce a grouped list of office. Finally, you must
-- add the office names to the output list.

-- The numbers don't change, just the order presented in the crosstab.

SELECT *
FROM crosstab('SELECT flavor,
                      office,
                      count(*)

-- Chapter 13: Mining Text to Find Meaningful Data
--------------------------------------------------------------

-- 1. The style guide of a publishing company you're writing for wants you to
-- avoid commas before suffixes in names. But there are several names like
-- Alvarez, Jr. and Williams, Sr. in your author database. Which functions can
-- you use to remove the comma? Would a regular expression function help?
-- How would you capture just the suffixes to place them into a separate column?

-- Answer: You can use either the standard SQL replace() function or the
-- PostgreSQL regexp_replace() function:

SELECT replace('Williams, Sr.', ', ', ' ');
SELECT regexp_replace('Williams, Sr.', ', ', ' ');

-- Answer: To capture just the suffixes, search for characters after a comma
-- and space and place those inside a match group:

SELECT (regexp_match('Williams, Sr.', '.*, (.*)'))[1];


-- 2. Using any one of the State of the Union addresses, count the number of
-- unique words that are five characters or more. Hint: you can use
-- regexp_split_to_table() in a subquery to create a table of words to count.
-- Bonus: remove commas and periods at the end of each word.

-- Answer:

WITH
    word_list (word)
AS
    (
        SELECT regexp_split_to_table(speech_text, '\s') AS word
        FROM president_speeches
        WHERE speech_date = '1974-01-30'
    )

SELECT lower(
               replace(replace(replace(word, ',', ''), '.', ''), ':', '')
             ) AS cleaned_word,
       count(*)
FROM word_list
WHERE length(word) >= 5
GROUP BY cleaned_word
ORDER BY count(*) DESC;

-- Note: This query uses a Common Table Expression to first separate each word
-- in the text into a separate row in a table named word_list. Then the SELECT
-- statement counts the words, which are cleaned up with two operations. First,
-- several nested replace functions remove commas, periods, and colons. Second,
-- all words are converted to lowercase so that when we count we group words
-- that may appear with various cases (e.g., "Military" and "military").


-- 3. Rewrite the query in Listing 13-25 using the ts_rank_cd() function
-- instead of ts_rank(). According to th PostgreSQL documentation, ts_rank_cd()
-- computes cover density, which takes into account how close the lexeme search
-- terms are to each other. Does using the ts_rank_cd() function significantly
-- change the results?

-- Answer:
-- The ranking does change, although the same speeches are generally
-- represented. The change might be more or less pronounced given another set
-- of texts.

SELECT president,
       speech_date,
       ts_rank_cd(search_speech_text, search_query, 2) AS rank_score
FROM president_speeches,
     to_tsquery('war & security & threat & enemy') search_query
WHERE search_speech_text @@ search_query
ORDER BY rank_score DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- Chapter 14: Analyzing Spatial Data with PostGIS
--------------------------------------------------------------

-- 1. Earlier, you found which US county has the largest area. Now,
-- aggregate the county data to find the area of each state in square
-- miles. (Use the statefp10 column in the us_counties_2010_shp table.)
-- How many states are bigger than the Yukon-Koyukuk area?

-- Answer: Just three states are bigger than Yukon-Koyukuk: Of course,
-- one is Alaska itself (FIPS 02). The other two are Texas (FIPS 48),
-- and California (FIPS 06).

SELECT statefp10 AS st,
       round (
              ( sum(ST_Area(geom::geography) / 2589988.110336))::numeric, 2
             ) AS square_miles
FROM us_counties_2010_shp
GROUP BY statefp10
ORDER BY square_miles DESC;

-- 2. Using ST_Distance(), determine how many miles separate these two farmersâ€™
-- markets: the Oakleaf Greenmarket (9700 Argyle Forest Blvd, Jacksonville,
-- Florida) and Columbia Farmers Market (1701 West Ash Street, Columbia,
-- Missouri). Youâ€™ll need to first find the coordinates for both in the
-- farmers_markets table.
-- Tip: you can also write this query using the Common Table Expression syntax
-- you learned in Chapter 12.

-- Answer: About 851 miles.

WITH
    market_start (geog_point) AS
    (
     SELECT geog_point
     FROM farmers_markets
     WHERE market_name = 'The Oakleaf Greenmarket'
    ),
    market_end (geog_point) AS
    (
     SELECT geog_point
     FROM farmers_markets
     WHERE market_name = 'Columbia Farmers Market'
    )
SELECT ST_Distance(market_start.geog_point, market_end.geog_point) / 1609.344 -- convert to meters to miles
FROM market_start, market_end;

-- 3. More than 500 rows in the farmers_markets table are missing a value
-- in the county column, an example of dirty government data. Using the
-- us_counties_2010_shp table and the ST_Intersects() function, perform a
-- spatial join to find the missing county names based on the longitude and
-- latitude of each market. Because geog_point in farmers_markets is of the
-- geography type and its SRID is 4326, youâ€™ll need to cast geom in the Census
-- table to the geography type and change its SRID using ST_SetSRID().

-- Answer:

SELECT census.name10,
       census.statefp10,
       markets.market_name,
       markets.county,
       markets.st
FROM farmers_markets markets JOIN us_counties_2010_shp census
    ON ST_Intersects(markets.geog_point, ST_SetSRID(census.geom,4326)::geography)
    WHERE markets.county IS NULL
ORDER BY census.statefp10, census.name10;

-- Note that this query also highlights a farmer's market that is mis-geocoded.
-- Can you spot it?

-- Chapter 15: Saving Time with Views, Functions, and Triggers
--------------------------------------------------------------

-- 1. Create a view that displays the number of New York City taxi trips per
-- hour. Use the taxi data in Chapter 11 and the query in Listing 11-8.

-- Answer:

CREATE VIEW nyc_taxi_trips_per_hour AS
    SELECT
         date_part('hour', tpep_pickup_datetime),
         count(date_part('hour', tpep_pickup_datetime))
    FROM nyc_yellow_taxi_trips_2016_06_01
    GROUP BY date_part('hour', tpep_pickup_datetime)
    ORDER BY date_part('hour', tpep_pickup_datetime);

SELECT * FROM nyc_taxi_trips_per_hour;

-- 2. In Chapter 10, you learned how to calculate rates per thousand. Turn that
-- formula into a rates_per_thousand() function that takes three arguments
-- to calculate the result: observed_number, base_number, and decimal_places.

-- Answer: This uses PL/pgSQL, but you could use a SQL function as well.

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION
rate_per_thousand(observed_number numeric,
                  base_number numeric,
                  decimal_places integer DEFAULT 1)
RETURNS numeric(10,2) AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN
        round(
        (observed_number / base_number) * 1000, decimal_places
        );
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Test the function:

SELECT rate_per_thousand(50, 11000, 2);

-- 3. In Chapter 9, you worked with the meat_poultry_egg_inspect table that
-- listed food processing facilities. Write a trigger that automatically adds an
-- inspection date each time you insert a new facility into the table. Use the
-- inspection_date column added in Listing 9-19, and set the date to be six
-- months from the current date. You should be able to describe the steps needed
-- to implement a trigger and how the steps relate to each other.

-- Answer:
-- a) Add the column

ALTER TABLE meat_poultry_egg_inspect ADD COLUMN inspection_date date;

-- b) Create the function that the trigger will execute.

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION add_inspection_date()
    RETURNS trigger AS $$
    BEGIN
       UPDATE meat_poultry_egg_inspect
       SET inspection_date = now() + '6 months'::interval; -- Here, we set the inspection date to six months in the future
    RETURN NEW;
    END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- c) Create the trigger

CREATE TRIGGER inspection_date_update
  AFTER INSERT
  ON meat_poultry_egg_inspect
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE PROCEDURE add_inspection_date();

-- d) Test the insertion of a company and examine the result

INSERT INTO meat_poultry_egg_inspect(est_number, company)
VALUES ('test123', 'testcompany');

SELECT * FROM meat_poultry_egg_inspect
WHERE company = 'testcompany';
